# SudokuSolver-using-DIP-OpenCV
This project combines computer vision (OpenCV in Python) with advanced algorithms (Dancing Links in C++) to create a robust Sudoku-solving solution. Leveraging OpenCV's image processing capabilities and the powerful problem-solving prowess of Dancing Links, the system effectively detects, processes, and solves Sudoku puzzles.
